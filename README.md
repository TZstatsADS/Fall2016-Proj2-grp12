In this second project of Applied Data Science, we will carry out *Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization* via a shiny app on a topic about open data released from the [New York City open data portal](https://nycopendata.socrata.com/). See [Project 2 Description](doc/project2_desc.md) for more details.  

We filtered those cafe & bars & bakeries with free or limited free wifi covered. And if you type in your address, you will find all the places you can sit with wifi connections in a specific distance you prefer.

This app is very convinient to use and quite practical.

We hope you all have fun with it.
